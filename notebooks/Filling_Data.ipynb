    "# Data Transformations with Pandas in Python - Creating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the notebook on filling missing data. In this notebook we will learn different techniques for filling missing data using Python. In general there are two approaches:\n",
    "1. Filling by providing a value (or multiple values)\n",
    "2. Filling by using a method: forward fill & backward fill\n",
    "\n",
    "But first one remark. **The biggest challenge in filling missing data is to properly prepare your data**. For this data preparation you will need (depending on your data) tools like `.melt()` or `.pivot()` (see notebook `Transforming_Data.ipynb`), indexing and joining (see notebook `Combining_Data.ipynb`), aggregating with functions like `.groupby()` and `.resample()`, etcetera. In other words: Python can fill missing data, but only with well organized data. So you need to know how to (re)organize your data and how you want to fill your missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not pay attention to all those preparatory steps, and only focuses on the actual filling of missing data. You will see that this is actually quite easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a simple dataframe, with some columns and some missing data. Run below code cell."

We can take the average with the function `.mean()`, however, that gives us the average _per column_. Instead, we want the average _per row_. That is possible by using the `axis` argument: by default the `axis` is 0 (meaning average over the row dimension - getting one value per column), but you can set it to 1 (meaning average over the column dimension - getting one value per row). If we do that for columns `Temp2` and `Temp3`, we can use the resulting averages per row to fill column `Temp1`. See below example."
